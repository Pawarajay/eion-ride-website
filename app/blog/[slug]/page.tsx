          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            "I was working 12-hour days in a software company, barely seeing my family," says Suresh. 
            "The stress was affecting my health, and despite a decent salary, I felt trapped in the 
            corporate rat race."

            After researching various ride-sharing platforms, Suresh chose Eion Rides for its 
            fair commission structure and driver-friendly policies. "The transparent pricing 
            and lower commission rates made the decision easy," he explains.

            "Now I'm my own boss," Suresh smiles. "I can take breaks when I want, spend time 
            with my family, and I'm earning more than my corporate job. The best part is the 
            flexibility and meeting new people every day."
